# CPU---Scheduling
Sample imput and output.
Sample I/O dispalyed once at a time.
Enter number of processes: 5
Enter arrival time and CPU burst time respectively:
0 5
1 3
2 1
3 2
4 3
Choose type of CPU Scheduling:
1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
2. Shortest Job First (preemptive)
3. Shortest Job First (non-preemptive)
4. Priority Scheduling (preemptive)
5. Priority Scheduling (non-preemptive)
6. Round Robin Scheduling
6
Enter quantam time : 2

Waiting Time and Turnaround Time of processes are: 
Process 1: Waiting Time = 8, Turnaround Time = 13
Process 2: Waiting Time = 8, Turnaround Time = 11
Process 3: Waiting Time = 2, Turnaround Time = 3
Process 4: Waiting Time = 4, Turnaround Time = 6
Process 5: Waiting Time = 7, Turnaround Time = 10
Average Waiting Time: 5.8
Average Turnaround Time: 8.6
