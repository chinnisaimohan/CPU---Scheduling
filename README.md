# CPU---Scheduling
Using Cpp different mode of CPU scheduling algorithms are coded 

My PROJECT DOESN'T HAVE FRONTEND AS I DON'T KNOW HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.

Please accept as it's very difficult to learn web devlopment in 2-3 weeks.

This project has 2 branches one "main" and "SampleI/O".
main: contains 2 files Code.cpp and README.md 
Code.cpp is for cpp code and README is for instructions as mentioned in forms
SampleI/O branch conatins README.md file which conatins sample input/output format.
How to run the project : 
To clone my repository and work on it locally, you can use the following steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Run the following command to clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/chinnisaimohan/CPU---Scheduling.git

Navigate into the cloned repository: cd CPU_SCHEDULER

Open the project in your preferred code editor: For example, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can run: code .

Running cpp code : Save the code which was named as Code.cpp in main directory in VS Code with a name (for example Code.cpp) . It then compiles the Code.cpp file into an executable (Code.exe) using the g++ compiler. The compiled executable is executed with input.
Note: If we use online compilers few may work one line to line and waits for the user to give input and my project is so ease to handle or give input.
But some other online compilers and VS CODE may not work as easy to my code while giving input. 

So here are the following instructions to give input i.e internal working of the project.
The internal working of your project:

1.Give input as number of processes that you have schedule.
2.Enter arrival time and CPU burst time of the processes respectively.
3.Choose type of CPU Scheduling: (choose a number)
  1. First Come First Serve (FCFS)
  2. Shortest Job First (preemptive)
  3. Shortest Job First (non-preemptive)
  4. Priority Scheduling (preemptive)
  5. Priority Scheduling (non-preemptive)
  6. Round Robin Scheduling
Depending on the choices(number) you choose it works based on that.
4.If it was 1/2/3 No additional input has to be provided.
  Else if 4/5 Give the priorities of the processes respectively
  Else 6 give the time quantum for round robin scheduling algorithm.
5.Then the code runs and displays waiting and turnaround times of all the given processes respectively.
6. At last it displays the average waiting and turnaround times.

Learning Takeaways from the Project:

1. As in C++ I learned many ways to think to approach a problem and I explored Cpp a lot and ways to optimise code .

2.Understanding Scheduling Algorithms: Working on the Code.cpp file deepened my understanding of various CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, priority scheduling, and round-robin, and how to implement and test them.
