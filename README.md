# CPU---Scheduling
Using Cpp different mode of CPU scheduling algorithms are coded
My PROJECT DOSEN'T HAVE FRONTEND AS I DON'T KNOW HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT.
Please accept as it's very difficult to learn in 2-3 weeks.
So here are the links for sample inputs and sample outputs 
How to run the project : 
To clone my repository and work on it locally, you can use the following steps:

Open your terminal or command prompt.

Navigate to the directory where you want to clone the repository.

Run the following command to clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/chinnisaimohan/CPU---Scheduling.git

Navigate into the cloned repository: cd CPU_SCHEDULER

Open the project in your preferred code editor: For example, if you're using Visual Studio Code, you can run: code .

Running cpp code : Save the code which was named as Code.cpp in main directory in VS Code with a name (for example scheduler.cpp) . It then compiles the scheduler.cpp file into an executable (scheduler.exe) using the g++ compiler. The compiled executable is executed with input.
Learning Takeaways from the Project:

1. As in C++ I learned many ways to think to approach a problem and I explored Cpp alot 

2.Understanding Scheduling Algorithms: Working on the scheduler.cpp file deepened my understanding of various CPU scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, priority scheduling, and round-robin, and how to implement and test them.

Resources and References used: • I learned about CPU SCHEDULING and the scheduling algorithms from youtube. The playlist which was sent to us in the discord. •  I enhanced the codes with the help of chatgpt. • ChatGPT for assistance with error handling, integration of frontend and backend, and overall project guidance.
